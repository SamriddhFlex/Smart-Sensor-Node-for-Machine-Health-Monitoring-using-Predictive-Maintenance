# Smart-Sensor-Node-for-Machine-Health-Monitoring-using-Predictive-Maintenance
Built an IoT-based predictive maintenance system using STM32 and a table fan motor.  Collected current, vibration, and temperature data using multiple sensors.  Applied unsupervised ML clustering to detect normal and anomalous conditions.  Used ESP32 with AWS cloud for data storage, monitoring, and alerts.
